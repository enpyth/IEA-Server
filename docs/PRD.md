# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**National Health and Wellbeing Expert Information Platform**

The health and wellbeing industry is rapidly growing worldwide, requiring stronger collaboration between academia and industry. In Australia, expert resources are scattered across universities, and stakeholders face challenges such as information asymmetry and inefficient communication.

Existing platforms (e.g., Google Scholar, LinkedIn) provide partial individual information but lack a systematic, cross-institutional, and domain-specific solution.
This platform aims to create a **national expert information hub** for the Australian health and wellbeing sector, enabling structured data access, intelligent search, and collaboration opportunities.
